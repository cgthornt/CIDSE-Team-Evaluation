Application Helpers
===================
This folder contains application helpers. Helpers are snippets of PHP code and functions intended to aid in small tasks.
## Usage
To use, simply create a file called `ControllerNameHelper.php`. Now whenever a user is using the `ControllerName` controller, this file will automatically be loaded.

There is a special file called `ApplicationHelper.php` that will automatically be included for every request.
